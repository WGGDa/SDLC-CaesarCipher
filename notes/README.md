# In this project we'll create a Caesar Cipher:
  - It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter

  - In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, 
  Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques
# Key Takeaway from this lesson:

> Need to understand the mindset of how you set up a project & what is a part of that logic 
> The start of a problem:
- What is the problem that you are trying to solve/ what are you trying to create
- What are the starting variables that you need to account for & their uses/purpose
- How does each variable need to be set up/ what will they hold the properties of
